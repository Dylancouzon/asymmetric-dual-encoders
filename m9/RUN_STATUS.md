# M9.3 build — live status

## Stop, cool down, restart

1. Stop safely: `touch work/m9long/ckpt/STOP`. Keep the watchdog running;
   it supervises until `terminal.json` confirms the trainer exited.
2. Cool down: after that terminal marker appears, run
   `setsid nohup .venv/bin/python m9src/watchdog.py --cooldown --hours 4 >> logs/m9_watchdog.log 2>&1 &`.
   The cooldown command safely consumes the acknowledged STOP and terminal markers, resumes
   `last.pt` in decay, and supervises it through `cooldown complete`.
3. Restart after a crash: if the watchdog is alive, do nothing; it restarts the trainer exactly.
   If the watchdog died, rerun the original watchdog launch command. It reuses `deadline.json`,
   attaches to a live trainer or resumes `last.pt`, and never resets the seven-day horizon.
